This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Welcome to the The Photo Shop!

## This projects intention is to learn and hone my skills in React

The idea is to create a clone of an E-Commerce Website where users can look at images, favorite them, and add them to their shopping cart. Thus the reason it's called The Photo Shop.

We have a cart page that lists the items that were added and we can delete them.

This project utilizes concepts such as React-Router, React-Hooks, React-Context, and React-PropTypes.

For the CSS, we utilized the CSS Grid and have a utilities folder that decides the sizes of each image

This is a capstone project that is heavily derived from Bob Ziroll's "Become a professional React developer" and it's thanks to his course and also to Learn Academy's Coding Bootcamp, that I'm able to utilize and fully understand React to create this project.
